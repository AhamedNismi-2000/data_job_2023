# Job Market Skill Complexity Analysis – Excel, Power Query & Power Pivot

## 👋 Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to perform **end-to-end data analysis** using **Microsoft Excel**, with a focus on understanding **how skill complexity relates to salary levels across different countries**.

The analysis explores the relationship between **median salary** and **skills required per job**, using **explicit DAX measures** and a **scatter plot visualization**.  
Data preparation was handled using **Power Query**, while **Power Pivot** was used for **data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive analysis**.

This project reflects core skills expected from a **Data Analyst**, including ETL, data modeling, DAX, visualization, and insight generation.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
The objective of this analysis is to:
- Measure **skill intensity (skills per job)** across roles
- Analyze how **median salary varies with skill complexity**
- Compare **skill requirements across countries**
- Enable **interactive, country-level exploration** of job market trends
- Support **data-driven recruitment and workforce planning decisions**

---

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL)
- Power Query
- Power Pivot (Data Modeling)
- DAX Explicit Measures
- Scatter Plot Visualization
- Interactive dashboards using slicers
- Analytical reasoning & data storytelling

---

## 📊 Data Preparation & Modeling
The ETL and modeling workflow includes:

1. Imported datasets using **Power Query**
2. Cleaned and standardized job and skill data
3. Built a **Power Pivot data model**
4. Created explicit **DAX measures**, including:
   - **Skill Count**
   - **Job Count**
   - **Skills per Job** (derived measure)
5. Enabled **country-based filtering** through slicers

This approach ensures **accurate metrics, scalability, and analytical flexibility**.

---

## 📈 Data Visualization & Analysis
The final analysis is presented using a **Scatter Plot** built on Power Pivot measures.

### Visualization Design
- **Chart Type:** Scatter Plot
- **X-Axis:** Median Salary
- **Y-Axis:** Skills per Job
- **Data Points:** Job roles / skill groups
- **Slicer:** Country

This visualization highlights how **skill requirements and salary levels vary across countries**, making it easy to identify:
- High-paying roles requiring broader skill sets
- Country-specific differences in skill complexity
- Roles with efficient salary-to-skill ratios

---

## 🎛 Interactivity & User Experience
- **Country slicer** allows users to dynamically filter the analysis by region
- All metrics and visuals update instantly based on selections
- Enables **self-service, exploratory analysis** similar to professional BI dashboards
