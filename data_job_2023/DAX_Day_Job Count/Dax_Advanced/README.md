# Job Market Skill Complexity Analysis – Excel, Power Query & Power Pivot

## 👋 Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to perform **end-to-end data analysis** using **Microsoft Excel**, with a focus on understanding **how skill complexity relates to salary levels in the job market**.

The analysis explores the relationship between **median salary** and **skills required per job**, using **explicit DAX measures** and a **scatter plot visualization**.  
Data preparation was handled using **Power Query**, while **Power Pivot** was used for data modeling and measure creation.

This project reflects core skills expected from a **Data Analyst**, including ETL, data modeling, DAX calculations, and analytical visualization.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
The objective of this analysis is to:
- Measure **skill intensity (skills per job)** across roles
- Analyze how **median salary varies with skill complexity**
- Identify roles that require **broader skill sets**
- Support **data-driven insights** for recruitment and workforce planning

---

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL)
- Power Query
- Power Pivot (Data Modeling)
- DAX Measures (Explicit Measures)
- Scatter Plot Visualization
- Analytical reasoning & data storytelling

---

## 📊 Data Preparation & Modeling
The ETL and modeling workflow includes:

1. Imported datasets using **Power Query**
2. Cleaned and standardized job and skill data
3. Built a **Power Pivot data model**
4. Created explicit **DAX measures**, including:
   - **Skill Count**
   - **Job Count**
   - **Skills per Job** (derived measure)
5. Ensured accurate aggregation for analytical visualization

This approach ensures **reliable metrics and scalable analysis**.

---

## 📈 Data Visualization & Analysis
The final analysis is presented using a **Scatter Plot** built on Power Pivot measures.

### Visualization Design
- **Chart Type:** Scatter Plot
- **X-Axis:** Median Salary
- **Y-Axis:** Skills per Job
- **Data Points:** Job roles / skill groups (based on the data model)

This visualization highlights the relationship between **salary levels and required skill breadth**, making it easier to identify:
- High-paying roles with high skill complexity
- Roles with fewer required skills but competitive salaries

---

## 🎛 Interactivity & User Experience
- The dashboard is powered by **Power Pivot measures**
- Users can interact with filters or slicers (if applied)
- Visuals update dynamically based on selected criteria

This enables a **self-service analytical experience**, similar to professional BI tools.

## 📌 Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Translate raw data into **meaningful analytical measures**
- Use **DAX** to derive business-relevant metrics
- Design visualizations that reveal **non-obvious relationships**
- Apply Excel beyond basic reporting into **analytical modeling**

It highlights essential **Data Analyst competencies**: Power Query, Power Pivot, DAX, visualization, and insight generation.
