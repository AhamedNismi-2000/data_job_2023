## 🧠 Analysis 3: Skill Complexity vs Median Salary

### Objective
Understand how **skill complexity (skills per job)** relates to **median salary**, with cross-country comparison.

### Methodology
- Prepared job and skill datasets using **Power Query**
- Modeled relationships using **Power Pivot**
- Created explicit DAX measures:
  - Skill Count  
  - Job Count  
  - Skills per Job

## 🔗 Analysis 4: Skill Type vs Salary & Demand (DAX CROSSFILTER)

### Objective
Analyze **median salary and demand by skill type**, resolving data model filter-direction limitations.

### The Challenge
The relationship between the **skills table** and **salary table** did not allow salary values to be filtered correctly by skill.

### The Solution
Used **DAX `CROSSFILTER`** inside explicit measures to temporarily control filter direction, enabling:
- Correct salary aggregation by skill
- Accurate skill demand calculation
- Reliable analysis without modifying the physical data model

### Visualization Design
- **Chart Type:** Combo Chart (Column + Line)  
- **X-Axis:** Skills  
- **Primary Y-Axis:** Median Salary  
- **Secondary Y-Axis:** Skill Count  
- **Slicers:** Country, Job Title
